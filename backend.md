# Microservices Architecture: Enterprise Application

## Microservice 1: User Management

**Responsibilities:**
- User authentication (login, logout)
- User registration and profile management

**Components:**
- Spring Boot Application
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database
- MySQL or PostgreSQL database for user data storage
- RESTful API endpoints for user operations

## Microservice 2: Product Catalog

**Responsibilities:**
- Managing product information (add, update, retrieve)
- Handling product availability

**Components:**
- Spring Boot Application
- Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database
- PostgreSQL database for product data storage
- RESTful API endpoints for product operations
- Integration with Microservice 3 for checking product availability

## Microservice 3: Order Processing

**Responsibilities:**
- Order creation and management
- Payment processing and integration
- Order fulfillment

**Components:**
- Spring Boot Application
- Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database
- MongoDB database for order data storage
- RESTful API endpoints for order operations
- Integration with Microservices 1 and 2 for user and product information
- Integration with payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)

## Shared Components:

**API Gateway:**
- Responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices
- Spring Cloud Gateway can be used

**Service Discovery:**
- Allows microservices to discover and locate each other
- Eureka (part of Spring Cloud) is a good choice

**Configuration Server:**
- Centralized configuration management for microservices
- Spring Cloud Config can be utilized

**Authentication/Authorization Server:**
- Manages user authentication and authorization
- Uses OAuth2 and Spring Security

**Message Broker (Optional for Asynchronous Communication):**
- Facilitates event-driven communication between microservices
- Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ can be used

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging

## Deployment:

- Use Docker containers for each microservice to ensure consistency across environments.
- Kubernetes for container orchestration, scaling, and management.

## Technology Stack:

- Programming Language: Java
- Microservices Framework: Spring Boot
- API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway
- Service Discovery: Eureka (Spring Cloud)
- Configuration Server: Spring Cloud Config
- Authentication/Authorization: Spring Security, OAuth2
- Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL for user and product data, MongoDB for orders
- Message Broker (Optional): Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
