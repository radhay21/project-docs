# Spring Boot REST API Backend and Angular Web Application

## Spring Boot REST API Backend

### Backend API Design
- Define clear API endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Follow RESTful principles for designing the API structure.

### Maven Build Tool
- Use Maven for managing project dependencies and building the Spring Boot application.

### Database Design
- Design the database schema based on the application's requirements.
- Define relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Choose appropriate data types for each field.

### Application Domain Design
- Identify and model the core domain entities and their attributes.
- Create appropriate entity classes and define JPA annotations.

### Layered Architecture
- Implement a layered architecture for the application (e.g., controller, service, repository).
- Keep business logic, data access, and presentation concerns separate.

### HTTP Protocol with REST API
- Utilize the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
- Handle HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

### Spring Security
- Implement Spring Security to secure the REST endpoints.
- Configure authentication and authorization rules.

### Security with JSON Web Token (JWT) and Refresh Token
- Integrate JWT for stateless authentication.
- Use refresh tokens to extend the validity of JWT tokens.

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Implement multi-factor authentication for added security layers.
- Combine password-based login with an additional authentication method.

### Text Message Login Verification Code
- Enable login verification through text messages.
- Generate and validate verification codes sent via SMS.

### Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC
- Use Spring Data JPA for easy database access and querying.
- Consider Spring Data JDBC for simpler data access when needed.

### Application Event Publisher
- Utilize Spring's event publisher mechanism for handling application events.
- Implement event listeners to respond to specific events.

### Exception Handling
- Implement global exception handling for consistent error responses.
- Customize exception classes for different types of errors.

### CD/CI Pipeline (Continuous Delivery/Integration)
- Set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI.
- Automate build, testing, and deployment processes.

### Deployment
- Deploy the Spring Boot application to a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Configure environment-specific properties for different deployment stages.

## Angular Web Application

### Angular Architecture
- Follow the recommended Angular application architecture, separating components, services, and modules.

### TypeScript
- Write code using TypeScript for strong typing and enhanced tooling support.

### Angular Modules
- Organize features into Angular modules to encapsulate related components, services, and directives.

### Angular Directives
- Implement structural directives (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor) to conditionally render elements.
- Use attribute directives (e.g., *ngClass, *ngStyle) to modify the appearance or behavior of elements.

### Angular Components
- Understand component lifecycle hooks and use them appropriately.
- Create component templates using Angular's template syntax.
- Implement communication between components using input and output properties.

### Data Binding
- Utilize string interpolation for one-way data binding.
- Implement property binding to bind component properties to HTML element properties.
- Use event binding to respond to user interactions.

### Angular Services
- Create services to encapsulate business logic and data retrieval.
- Inject services into components to access their functionality.

### Angular Interceptors
- Implement interceptors to modify HTTP requests or responses globally.
- Add headers or handle errors in a centralized manner.

### Angular Resolvers
- Use resolvers to prefetch data before activating a route.
- Ensure the route is loaded only after the required data is available.

### Angular Pipes
- Apply pipes for transforming and formatting data in templates.
- Use built-in pipes or create custom pipes for specific use cases.

### Angular Routing
- Configure the Angular router to handle different application views.
- Set up route parameters and query parameters for dynamic content.

### Angular Guards
- Implement route guards to control access to certain routes based on user authentication or roles.

### RxJS
- Use RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and managing data streams.
- Employ operators for transforming, filtering, and combining data.

### State Management
- Choose a state management approach such as NgRx or Angular services to manage application-wide state.

### Deployment
- Deploy the Angular application to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages) or integrate with the Spring Boot backend deployment.
