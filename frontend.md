- API Integration: Use Axios (for React) or Angular HttpClient (for Angular) to communicate with the backend microservices.
- Payment Integration: Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure payment processing.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
